  Challenge 12

## Project Overview
I am helping Roza complete her dashboard on bellybutton diversity. Her recent research to find the different type of bacteria that can be found in the human body. She has gathered the data and now it is time to put in a visual appealng database for her volunteers and collaborators to utilize. The dashboard has a drop down menu where you can select the participants ID # (keeping confidentatiality and anonymity) and 3 charts will populate with the corresponding data.
The first chart: Shows the Top 10 Bacterial Cultures among the Sample Values.

The second chart: Shows the frequency of belly button washes within a 1 week time period.
